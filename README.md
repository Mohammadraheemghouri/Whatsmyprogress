# progress tracker

A web application designed to keep track of task's/Jobs of an individual 


:: HTML CSS
:: Materialize.
:: Express.
:: NodeJS. 
:: Mongoose.
:: Embeded Javascript.


For Front-end Frameworks came in handy - In my case , I sticked with Materialize Framework

Mongodb - atlas is used as my database , its easier to manage with.

NodeJS , EJS and Express came in handy too..
